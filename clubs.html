                    Hi!<br>
                    I'm Anureet, the secretary of our school's tech club. I've always been fascinated by how technology can turn ideas into reality, whether it's through coding, robotics, AI, or animation. As secretary, I try contributing to the team by getting innovative ideas, do all the formal stuff, and support the team in making sure our projects stay on track. I believe that technology isn't just about machines, it's about creativity, collaboration, and solving real problems in fun and innovative ways. I love contributing to a space where everyone feels encouraged to experiment, learn, and share ideas freely. I'd describe myself as chill, curious, and always ready to crack a joke, even when the Wi-Fi betrays us. One quote I really connect with is: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." Through this club, I hope to help build a future where technology is not just smart, but meaningful.
