  <h2>Greetings All,</h2>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      Art Palette is a vibrant club where creativity meets expression. It’s a space for artists,
      painters, and designers to explore their imagination, experiment with new ideas, and bring colors to life.
      From sketching and painting to digital art and crafts, the club celebrates every form of artistic expression.
      Members collaborate on projects, organize exhibitions, and learn different art techniques through fun,
      hands-on activities. Art Palette encourages individuality while building teamwork and confidence through
      shared creativity. Whether it’s a brushstroke or a bold idea, every creation here adds to the canvas
      of imagination — because art is not just made, it’s felt.

      <h2>Kshitija-President</h2>
      <p>
As the President of Art Palette, I see art as a form of expression rather than perfection. For me, it’s about ideas, emotions, and personal style. I want Art Palette to be a space where creativity feels comfortable, experimentation is encouraged, and every artist feels confident sharing their work. My aim is to help students grow, collaborate, and find their own artistic voice. Together, I hope to build a community where creativity is valued, supported, and constantly evolving.<br><br>Warm Regards,<br>Kshitija

      <h2>Zoya-Vice President</h2>
      <p>
        "The pen is mightier than the sword” is a line I’ve heard since childhood, growing up with parents in law
        and a home where words carried weight. But even amid all that logic and legislation, the creative spark I
        carried from the moment I could hold a pencil was never dimmed.<br> Hey,<br>
        I’m Butool-though most people know me as Zoya-and I have the honour of serving as the first Vice President
        of Art for the Palette Club. With the support and encouragement I’ve received from my school, I’ve shaped
        that early spark into something meaningful,something I can share and give back through the work I do and the
        skills I continue to build.<br>
        I’ve always known I wanted to design. Ever since I learned how to draw, I filled pages with characters,
        patterns, outfits, and anything my imagination reached for. I picked up every hobby I could-from learning new
        languages to pottery-to expand my horizons and explore different forms of creativity. Designing is the
        passion that has always spoken loudest to me, and it still drives me today: the desire to create,
        communicate, and bring ideas to life in a way that feels thoughtful, expressive, and personal.<br>
        By the words of Vincent van Gogh: “I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.”

      <h2>Devanshi-Vice President</h2>
      <p>
        Art, my dearest empathiser;
For as long as I can remember, art has been more than a pastime. It has been my safe space, my language, and the way I’ve made sense of moments when I felt overwhelmed. Sketching, painting, crafting—each has carried me through different phases of my life, helping me understand myself better.<br>
Hi, I’m Devanshi, and I’m truly honoured to serve as the Vice President of the Art Club. I’m deeply grateful to my school for trusting me with this role, and I hope to make the most of this opportunity by sharing the knowledge, skills, and passion that art has given me. What makes art so special is that every person has their own unique way of expressing themselves through it—no two creations ever feel the same. As Vice President, I hope to help others discover that uniqueness within themselves, to explore not just how to make art, but how to feel it.
To me, art is an emotion before it is a skill. You don’t have to be “good” at it to belong here. And to everyone who says, “Art is not for me,” I hope this serves as a gentle reminder: art is for everyone. You just haven’t met the right version of it yet.<br><br>Warm Regards,<br>Devanshi
