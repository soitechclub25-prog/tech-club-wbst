                    Greetings Everyone,<br>It gives me immense pleasure to introduce our school clubs, which I truly believe are an important part of student life. Clubs give students the space to explore their interests, learn new skills, and grow in ways that the classroom alone cannot offer.<br><br>

As the Senior Mistress, I enjoy working closely with students and supporting their ideas and initiatives. I see clubs as places where confidence is built, leadership is discovered, and teamwork comes naturally. My aim is to ensure that every student feels encouraged to participate, express themselves freely, and make the most of the opportunities our clubs provide.<br><br>Warm Regards,<br>Shalini Ahuja,Senior Mistress

                    Dear Members,<br> "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen." – Winston Churchill<br>
I’m Udbhav, and I have the privilege of serving as the President of the MUN Society. Having chaired and represented in numerous MUNs, I’ve witnessed the power of debate, diplomacy, and dialogue firsthand. From the chaos of AIPPM to the precision of the UNSC, each experience has reinforced my belief that real change begins with meaningful discussion.
For me, MUNs are not just simulations—they’re spaces where ideas take shape, leaders emerge, and perspectives evolve. As President, my aim is to make this society a place where curiosity thrives, opinions are respected, and every voice finds its weight in the room.
When I’m not in committee, you’ll probably find me experimenting in the kitchen, scripting in Python, or dissecting world affairs over a late-night espresso. I believe diplomacy should be dynamic, bold, and driven by passion—and that’s exactly what I hope our MUN Society will embody.<br><br>
Warm regards,<br>
Udbhav Alam<br>
President, MUN Society
